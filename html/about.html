                      <p>Mardi Gras is full of secrets, and the Mardi Gras Indians are as much a part of
                          that secrecy as
                          any other carnival organization. Their parade dates, times and routes are never published in
                          advance, although they do tend to gather in the same areas every year.
                          <p>
                              The Mardi Gras Indians are comprised, in large part, of the African-American communities
                              of
                              New
                              Orleans's inner city. While these Indians have paraded for well over a century, their
                              parade
                              is
                              perhaps the least recognized Mardi Gras tradition.

                              is
                              loose,

                          Traditional Mardi Gras organizations form a "krewe." A krewe often names their parade after
                          a
                          particular Roman or Greek mythological hero or god. The ranking structure of a Mardi Gras
                          Krewe
                          is a parody of royalty: King, Queen, Dukes, Knights and Captains, or some variation of that
                          theme. Many of the more established krewes allow membership by invitation only.

                          Few in the ghetto felt they could ever participate in the typical New Orleans parade.
                          Historically, slavery and racism were at the root of this cultural separation. The black
                          neighborhoods in New Orleans gradually developed their own style of celebrating Mardi Gras.
                          Their krewes are named for imaginary Indian tribes according to the streets of their ward or
                          gang.

                          The Mardi Gras Indians named themselves after native Indians to pay them respect for their
                          assistance in escaping the tyranny of slavery. It was often local Indians who accepted
                          slaves
                          into their society when they made a break for freedom. They have never forgotten this
                          support.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                          Long ago, Mardi Gras was a violent day for many Mardi Gras Indians. It was a day often used
                          to
                          settle scores. The police were often unable to intervene due to the general confusion
                          surrounding Mardi Gras events in the city, when the streets were crowded and everyone was
                          masked. This kept many families away from the "parade," and created much worry and concern
                          for a
                          mothers whose children wanted to join the Indians.

                          Today when two Mardi Gras Indian tribes pass one another, you will see a living theater of
                          art
                          and culture. Each tribe's style and dress is on display in a friendly but competitive
                          manner.
                          They compare one another's art and craftsmanship.</p>

                      <p>
                          The Big Chiefs of two different tribes start with a song/chant, ceremonial dance, and
                          threatening challenge to "Humba". The Big Chief's demand that the other Chief bows and pays
                          respect. The retort is a whoop and equally impressive song and war dance with the reply, "Me
                          no
                          Humba, YOU Humba!"</p>

                          Although there was a history of violence, many now choose to keep this celebration friendly.
                          Each Big Chief will eventually stand back and, with a theatrical display of self-confidence,
                          acknowledge the artistry and craftsmanship of the other chief's suit.</p>

                      <p>
                          Before the progression can continue, the two Big Chiefs will often comment privately to one
                          another, "Looking good, baby, looking good!"</p>
                      <p>

                          The good news is Mardi Gras day is no longer a day to "settle scores" among the Mardi Gras
                          Indians. Now that the tradition and practice for the Indians to compare their tribal song,
                          dance
                          and dress with other tribes as they meet that day, violence is a thing of the past. The
                          Mardi
                          Gras Indian has invested thousands of hours and dollars in the creation of his suit, and
                          will
